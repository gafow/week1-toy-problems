 Toy Problems

This repository contains solutions for three week 1 toy problems code Challenge: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator. I used the problem to solve using JavaScript.

- Challenge 1 Student Grade Generator 
- Challenge 2 Speed Detector 
- Challenge 3 Net Salary Calculator 

## Challenge 1 Grade Generator

This project contains a function that prompts the user to input student marks and generates the corresponding grade based on the marks. The marks should be between 0 and 100, and the grades are assigned as follows:

 A: Marks > 79
 B: 60 to 79
 C: 50 to 59
 D: 40 to 49
 E: Marks < 40

```javascript
function studentGradeGenerator(marks) {
    if (marks > 79) return 'A';
    if (marks >= 60) return 'B';
    if (marks >= 50) return 'C';
    if (marks >= 40) return 'D';
    return 'E';

}
This program takes the speed of a car as input and determines whether the speed is within the limit or if the driver should receive demerit points.

Speed Criteria
Speed <= 70: "Ok"
For every 5 km/s above 70: 1 demerit point
Points > 12: "License suspended"

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

This program calculates an individualâ€™s net salary by taking into account the basic salary and benefits. It calculates the PAYE (Tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

### Inputs

- **Basic Salary**: The base salary of the individual.
- **Benefits**: Additional benefits provided to the individual.

### Outputs

- **Gross Salary**: The total salary before any deductions. Calculated as the sum of basic salary and benefits.
- **PAYE (Tax)**: Income tax based on the gross salary.
- **NHIF Deductions**: Health insurance deductions based on the gross salary.
- **NSSF Deductions**: Pension contributions based on the gross salary.
- **Net Salary**: The total salary after all deductions.

### Detailed Breakdown

#### Gross Salary Calculation

The gross salary is the sum of the basic salary and any benefits:

```javascript
const grossSalary = basicSalary + benefits;
